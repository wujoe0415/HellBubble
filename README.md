【Game Introduction】
(This game currently only has a Chinese version)
This is a stand-up comedy game where players take on the role of a comedian and aim to make the audience laugh. Within a limited time on stage, players use the mouse to click on button to complete various jokes.

When the audience laughs, it increases the "fun score."
If the audience is offended, it increases the "offense score."
If the offense score exceeds the fun score, the player goes to hell.
If the fun score is too low, the player also goes to hell.

As a professional comedian...
A. Going to hell is just part of the job.
B. It's my life's mission to make Diablo laugh.
C. Having a couple of 🍗🍗 jokes in my pocket is totally normal.
